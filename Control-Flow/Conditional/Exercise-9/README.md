# Smart Budgeting Assistant

## Write a program that receives the following value:
* **Monthly income**
* **Total expenses**
* **Total savings**


## The program must check:
* **If expenses ≤ 50% of income:**

  "Great job! You're saving well!"

* **If expenses between 50% and 80%:**

  "Consider reducing unnecessary expenses."

* **If expenses > 80%, check savings:**

  If savings ≥ 20% of income → "You're spending a lot, but savings help."
  Otherwise → "Warning! Your expenses are too high!"

### The program should display:
* **The message corresponding to the data.**
