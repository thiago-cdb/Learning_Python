# Maximum Distance of an Artillery Projectile

## Write a program that receives the following values:
* The initial velocity of the projectile (in meters per second).
* The launch angle of the artillery (in degrees).

## The program should calculate:
* The maximum distance the projectile can reach using the formula:  
  **Max Distance = (Initial Velocity² × sin(2 × Launch Angle in Radians)) / Gravity**

  (Note: The launch angle must be converted to radians first, and gravity is assumed to be 9.81 m/s².)

### The program should display:
* The entered initial velocity.
* The entered launch angle.
* The calculated maximum distance the projectile can travel.
