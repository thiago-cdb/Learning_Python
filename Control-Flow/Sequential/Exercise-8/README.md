* The interest rate (percent per month).
* The final amount (in dollars).

## The program should calculate:
* The necessary time (in months) to reach the final amount using the formula:  

  **Time = log(Final Amount / Initial Capital) / log(1 + Interest Rate)**  

### The program should display:
* The necessary time (in months).
