# Simple Interest Calculation

## Write a program that receives the following values:
* The initial capital (in dollars).
* The interest rate (percent per month).
* The time (in months).

## The program should calculate:
* The final amount of the deposit using the formula:  
 
  **Final Amount = Initial Capital + (Initial Capital × (Interest Rate / 100 × Time))**

* The profit, which is the difference between the final amount and the initial capital.

### The program should display:
* The final amount of the deposit (in dollars);
* The profit from the deposit (in dollars).
