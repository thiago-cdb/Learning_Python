# Distance Between Two Planets in Space

## Write a program that receives the following values:
* The x-coordinate of the first planet.
* The y-coordinate of the first planet.
* The z-coordinate of the first planet.
* The x-coordinate of the second planet.
* The y-coordinate of the second planet.
* The z-coordinate of the second planet.

## The program should calculate:
 * the distance between the two planets in space using the following formula:

   **Distance = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² + (z₂ - z₁)²)**

### The program should display:
* The distance between the two planets.
