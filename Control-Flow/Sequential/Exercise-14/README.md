# Distance Between Two Ships

## Write a program that receives the following values:
* The x-coordinate of the first ship.
* The y-coordinate of the first ship.
* The x-coordinate of the second ship.
* The y-coordinate of the second ship.

## The program should calculate:
* the distance between the two ships using the following formula:

  **Distance = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)**

### The program should display:
* The distance between the two ships, rounded to two decimal places.
